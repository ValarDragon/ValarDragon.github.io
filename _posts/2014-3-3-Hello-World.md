Hello! I'm Dev Ojha. 

This blog will have many miscellaneous things that interest me. I anticipate that I'll be making posts about in the weeds details / optimizations of zero-knowledge proofs, for CTF problems that I solve or write, algorithms I find fun, and many miscellaneous ideas for scaling blockchains. We'll see what I end up actually writing about :^)
