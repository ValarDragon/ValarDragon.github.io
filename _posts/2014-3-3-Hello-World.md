Hello! I'm Dev Ojha. This blog will contain postss about miscellaneous things that interest me. I anticipate that I'll be making posts about in the weeds details / optimizations of zero-knowledge proofs, for CTF problems that I solve or write, algorithms I find fun, and many miscellaneous ideas for scaling blockchains. We'll see what I end up actually writing about :^)

This blog's name, style and layout are all very subject to change.
